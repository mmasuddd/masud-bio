<h1> Climate Action Plan </h1>
<p>While as of right now, the ocelot's conservation status is of least concern. However, this was not the case before. Around 40 years ago, the US listed the ocelot's population as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. This was mostly because of humans killing ocelots because of their pelts. The destruction and fragmentation of ocelot's habitat also played a big role in the decreasing population of ocelots. This was because of the building of a new city. Some things that we put in place we laws. One law was the Endangered Species Conservation Act - States that the purposes of this Act are to provide a program for the conservation, protection, restoration, or propagation of species and subspecies of fish and wildlife that are threatened with extinction(Congress, 1973). Also, the USFWS(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) monitors the ocelot population and protects and restores thorn scrub habitat. They also work with the Texas Department of Transportation to install under-road wildlife crossings to help keep ocelots off the roads as vehicles pose the greatest immediate threat to Texas ocelots(Cincinnati Zoo).


<h2> Some things we can do right now to preserve ocelots:</h2>
<p> o Stop destroying where they live. This makes them more vulnerable to them dying. <br> o Advocate 
<br> o  Don't disturb ocelots if you come across one. Ocelots usually are not agressive and typically stray away from humans
<br> o Do not disturb the environment. This means do not use harsh and harmful chemicals around their envrionment.<p>
