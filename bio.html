<h1>Ocelot Analysis</h1>  
<p>Ocelots are very small and agile creatures. The reason why we should study ocelots is to track how they behave, thrive in their environment, and evolve. There are many ways to conserve ocelots; the biggest factor being fragmentation. Humans alone have caused many organisms such as ocelots to be displaced from their habitats. <br></p>

<h2>Distinct Characteristics & Natural History</h2>
<p> Ocelots possess thin, sharp, teeth so the process of hunting, killing, and consuming of an organism goes smoothly. Ground color varies. Ocelots have black-bordered spots run along the shoulders and back, have 1-2 stripes on the inner leg, and the back of their ears are black with a white spot in the center. Ocelots are secondary consumers and they eat a range of many things. Their main predators are larger wild cats (jaguars and pumas) and dogs but they are also susceptible to harm from anacondas, caimans and large eagles(Wong).


<h2> Life History </h2>
<p> Ocelots live somewhat shorter lives than domestic cats and jaguars. Ocelots have an 8-11 year lifespan. Ocelot females can breed when they are 8 months old, but they don't begin to do until they are 2 to 2 and a half years old. Ocelots typically give birth to 1-2 kittens, however they are capable of having up to 4 offspring. Ocelots give birth once or twice a year, usually in the winter and summer.
