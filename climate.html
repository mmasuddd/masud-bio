<h1>Climate Assessment</h1>
<p>Vulnerability Levels: H = High M = Medium L = Low U = Unknown L = Large = S = Small Y = Yes N = No G = Generalist S = Specialist LC = Least Concern </p>
<hr>


<h2> IUCN Red List Status: LC </h2>
<p> The ocelot’s vulnerability status right now is of least concern. This was not the case before however. Through 1960 to 1980, ocelots were approaching near extinction because of humans. Now, many countries have established lawsin place to protect ocelots.</p> 



<h2> Geographic Range: M </h2>

<p>The range of where ocelots are most common is from Northern Texas all the way down to Northern Argentina. The range of where they live is around 5800 miles long. </p>




<h2> Population Size: M </h2>

<p>While no one knows exactly how many ocelots are in the world, studies estimate that around 800 thousand to 1.5 million in the wild. Around 40 years ago, their population decreased heavily because of extensive fur trade. From the 1960s to 1980s, over 560 thousand ocelot pelts were sold.
 </p>



<h2> Temperature Tolerance: M</h2>

<p>Since ocelots live near the equator, ocelots can tolerate a medium temperature. Ocelots live where the temperature is from 68 degrees fahrenheit to 77 degrees fahrenheit.</p>




<h2> Does the species rely on environmental cues for reproduction?: N </h2>
<p>Ocelots do not rely on environmental and abiotic cues for reproduction. Ocelots usually mate during October. Temperature does also not influence offspring of an ocelot.</p>



<h2> Does the species rely on environmental cues for migration?: N </h2>
<p>Ocelots do not migrate at all. Male ocelots' home ranges vary from 1.2 to 18 square kilometers, while home ranges of females vary from about .8 to 15 square kilometers.
</p>

<h2> Does the species have any strong or symbiotic relationships with other species?: N </h2>
<p>Ocelots are mostly solitary all the time. Bobcats and ocelots coexist while also having similar charatceristsics, geographical range, and diet.
</p>

<h2> Diet: S </h2>
<p>The ocelot eats lots of things. They consume rabbits, rodents, iguanas, fish, and frogs. </p>

<h2> Abundance of Food Source: H</h2>
<p>Ocelots eat a range of many different animals. Since ocelots only eat a small amount of food per day, there is an abundance of food.</p>

<h2> Water Requirements: M</h2>
<p>Ocelots drink water on a daily basis just like many other animals. Just like leopards, ocelots also can obtain moisture from animals they hunt.</p>


<h2> Habitat Specialization: G</h2>
<p>Ocelots mainly live in the tropical rainforest, but they can also be found in different habitats.This species dwells in tropical and subtropical rainforests to semi-arid, dense thornscrub. It may enjoy partly cleared forests and second-growth woodland. This is because of their wide range of where they live. </p>

<h2>Dispersal Ability: H </h2>
<p> Ocelots typically weigh between 8 and 15 pounds, and they have been known to reach speeds of up to 30 miles per hour. Since ocelots live in the rainforest, fragmentation and the removal of their habitat is frequent. </p>

<h2> Generation Time: S</h2>
<p>The female sexual matruity is usually around 6 to 8 months old. That means they are able to reproduce at that age. However, they do not reproduce until they are around 2 to 2 ½ years old.</p>

<h2> Reproductive Rate: L</h2>
<p> Ocelots usually breed once per year. Ocelots gestation period is a little over two months and they give birth to 1 to 2 kittens.</p>

<h2> Genetic Variation: L</h2>
<p>Just like cheetahs, ocelots also have low genetic variation.
